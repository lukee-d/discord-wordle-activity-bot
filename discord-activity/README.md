## File Structure

```
discord-activity/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css      # CSS styles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ script.js       # Frontend JavaScript
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.js       # Node.js server
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ .env               # Environment variables
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Serve the main Activity page
- `GET /api/today-word` - Get today's Wordle word
- `POST /api/validate-word` - Validate if a word exists
- `GET /api/daily-results` - Get today's completion results
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `WebSocket /ws` - Real-time player updates

## WebSocket Events

### Client â†’ Server
- `player_joined` - Player joins the Activity
- `guess_update` - Player makes a guess
- `game_complete` - Player completes the game

### Server â†’ Client
- `players_update` - Updated list of active players
- `player_progress` - Individual player progress update

## How It Works

1. **Player joins**: Opens Activity in Discord, connects via WebSocket
2. **Game loads**: Fetches today's word, displays board and keyboard
3. **Real-time updates**: Other players see live progress (without spoilers)
4. **Game completion**: Results shared with other players
5. **Statistics**: Personal stats saved locally

## Differences from Bot Version

| Feature | Bot Version | Activity Version |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Interface | Discord embeds/modals | Full HTML/CSS/JS |
| Real-time | Limited updates | Full WebSocket sync |
| Multiplayer | Separate games | Shared experience |
| Platform | Any Discord channel | Voice channels/DMs only |
| Setup | Invite bot | Configure Activity |

## Development

### Running locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing with Discord
1. Use ngrok to expose local server
2. Update Discord Activity URL to ngrok URL
3. Test in Discord voice channel

### Adding features
- Modify `public/script.js` for frontend features
- Modify `src/server.js` for backend/WebSocket features
- Update `public/styles.css` for styling

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all user inputs
- Rate limit API endpoints for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Activity not loading
- Check Discord Developer Portal Activity URL
- Ensure server is accessible via HTTPS
- Check browser console for errors

### WebSocket connection issues
- Verify WebSocket endpoint is accessible
- Check firewall/proxy settings
- Ensure proper CORS configuration

### Word not loading
- Check API endpoints are working
- Verify word list is properly loaded
- Check server logs for errors
